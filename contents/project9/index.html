        You are a boy named Cross.
        
        You wake up in a cryopod, and as you get out of it, you look at your surroundings. It is filled with lab equipment.
        
        You then check yourself. You are dressed in a blue swimsuit with the characters '305f' barely readable. The swimsuit also outlines your penis.
        
        You see a door in the corner of the room.
        
        [[Go to the door|corridor1]]

    <loc id="corridor1">
        You go to the door and push it open.
        You are in a large corridor, with sirens blaring and the lights flickering red.
        You see two doors.

        [[Continue down the hallway|corridor4]]
    </loc>
    
    <loc id="corridor4">
        You walk down the hallway, and the sirens continue to blare.
        There are more doors along the corridor.

    <loc id="redRoom">
        You enter the red door and find yourself in a room filled with computer terminals.
        There is a note on one of the desks that reads:
        "To proceed, solve the following equation: 2 + 2 * 4 - 6 / 3"
