You wake up in a cryopod, disoriented and confused. As you slowly regain your senses, you realize that you are in a futuristic research facility. The last thing you remember is volunteering for a groundbreaking experiment.

The room you find yourself in is filled with advanced lab equipment and dimly lit. You check yourself and notice that you are dressed in a blue swimsuit with the characters '305f' barely readable. It seems like some sort of experimental garment.

As you try to make sense of your situation, you hear a voice coming from a loudspeaker in the room. It announces that a catastrophic event has occurred in the facility, and all personnel are advised to evacuate immediately. The voice urges you to find the nearest exit.

You glance around the room and notice a door in the corner. Without any other options, you decide to head towards the door and push it open. You step into a long corridor, dimly lit and eerily quiet.

As you explore the corridor, you come across various signs and symbols on the walls, hinting at the facility's purpose and the experiments conducted there. The air feels heavy with tension, and you can't shake the feeling that something is amiss.

Your main objective now is to navigate through the facility, uncover its secrets, and find a way to escape. Along the way, you will encounter puzzles, challenges, and other characters who may help or hinder your progress.

Your choices and actions will determine the outcome of your story. Will you uncover the truth behind the facility's experiments? Can you escape safely? The fate of Cross, the protagonist, is in your hands.
